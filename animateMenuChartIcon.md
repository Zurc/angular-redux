# animate chart menu icon

When?
Any time the user clicks on a readings point add button (adding to plots page) I want an animation on the chart icon on the Main menu.

So, the easiest way is to use a flag 'animateMenuChartIcon' on our state (boolean)

what files do I need to change?

### Actions

I need an ***action*** that I will trigger when the user press '+' btn on the readings panel

I need a second action to stop the animation
