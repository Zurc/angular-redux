      "description": "In the decade after World War II, jobs were defined by detailed activities; workers were expected to follow orders; supervisors had a limited span of control; work was closely supervised. Baby Boomers hadn't entered the employment ranks; women were limited to \"women's work\"; and the Civil Rights Act was a few years away. But in the past 20 years, knowledge workers have replaced manual workers, self-managed teams have replaced close supervision and focus has shifted to market values rather than internal job values. In this book, author Howard Risher, Ph.D., consolidates the body of knowledge needed to rethink a salary system in the 21st century, looking narrowly at the planning and modifying of salary programs for the benefit of HR professionals with little or no prior experience in redesigning salary programs.",

The content is wide ranging with a wealth of references, and includes recent case history of salary surveys and antitrust. It also covers specific guidelines promulgated by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission regarding surveys in the health care industry, potential adverse statistical implications of compliance with such guidelines, practices of companies and consulting firms regarding salary surveys, differing views of attorneys, and specific steps on how organizations should approach making a decision regarding whether to and to what degree they work within the guidelines. While this book focuses on salary surveys, the same principles and perspectives apply to the exchange of any human resources function, whether salaries, benefits, policies or practices.",
